# Task: apply the method of barrier functions by the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell method

The Davidon–Fletcher–Powell formulafinds the solution to the secant equation that is closest to the current estimate and satisfies the curvature condition. It was the first quasi-Newton method to generalize the secant method to a multidimensional problem. This update maintains the symmetry and positive definiteness of the Hessian matrix.
